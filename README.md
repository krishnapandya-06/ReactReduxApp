Redux Store & State Management

The application uses Redux Toolkit to manage authentication, counter, and to-do states efficiently.

1. Authentication (authSlice.js)

Manages user login, signup, and logout.

2. Counter (counterSlice.js)

Handles increment, decrement, and increment by 5 actions.

3. To-Do List (todoSlice.js)

Adds, toggles, and removes tasks.

Routing

The app uses React Router for navigation:

/auth â†’ Login & Signup (AuthPage.jsx)

/counter â†’ Counter Page

/todo â†’ To-Do Page

Default (/) â†’ Redirects to /auth
